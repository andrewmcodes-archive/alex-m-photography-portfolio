Hey there! My name is Alex and I am located in the Charlotte, North Carolina Area as of now. I picked up photography as a hobby during the summer of 2017. I am definitely no professional and still have a lot to learn, but enjoy taking pictures and seeing the beauty in all things. Some of my favorite things to take pictures of are people, nature, landscapes and random things from time to time.

I attended the University of North Carolina Wilmington for both my Bachelor's degree and my Master's degree. My undergrad was in Business Administration and I got a Master's in Science of Accountancy. When I'm not working or messing around with a camera, I enjoy running, hiking, rock climbing, swimming, and basically anything outdoors related. I'm a people person and enjoy meeting new people, going out for food and drinks, attending concerts and music festivals, and am always up for trying something new.

I am always up to shoots some pics and learn from others and help others learn so if anyone ever wants to meet up for a session or to collaborate I'm for sure down! I hope you enjoy my page and feel free to reach out if you have any questions, feedback, tips, comments, etc.
